/**
 *  A wrapper Container for holding components that use a background Color
 *  containing an alpha value with some transparency.
 *
 *  A Component that uses a transparent background should really have its
 *  opaque property set to false so that the area it occupies is first painted
 *  by its opaque ancestor (to make sure no painting artifacts exist). However,
 *  if the property is set to false, then most Swing components will not paint
 *  the background at all, so you lose the transparent background Color.
 *
 *  This components attempts to get around this problem by doing the
 *  background painting on behalf of its contained Component, using the
 *  background Color of the Component.
